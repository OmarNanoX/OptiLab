Description:
    OptiLab is a Python-based GUI tool for calculating and analyzing 
    the optical properties of thin films and solutions from UV-Vis data. 
    Features include:
        - Absorption coefficient, extinction coefficient, refractive index
        - Dielectric constant, dielectric loss, loss tangent
        - Tauc plots for band gap extraction (with error estimation)
        - Urbach energy analysis (with error estimation)
        - Export of results to Excel/CSV
        - Interactive Tkinter-based GUI
